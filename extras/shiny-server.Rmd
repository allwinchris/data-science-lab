Open Source Shiny Server provides a platform on which you can host multiple Shiny applications on a single server, each with their own URL or port. It enables you to support non-websocket-enabled browsers like Internet Explorer 10, and is available under an AGPLv3 license.

You should already have shiny, and rmarkdown installed. If not:

```{bash}
sudo /opt/R/3.4.3/bin/Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("shiny", "rmarkdown"), repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")'
```

Then, download Shiny server:

### Ubuntu

```{bash}
# Download
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-14.04/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.7.907-amd64.deb

# Install
sudo gdebi shiny-server-1.5.7.907-amd64.deb
```


### RedHat / CentOS

```{bash}
# Download
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos6.3/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.7.907-rh6-x86_64.rpm

# Install
sudo yum install --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.5.7.907-rh6-x86_64.rpm
```
