```{bash}
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

To enable an instance of Nginx running on the same server to act as a front-end proxy to RStudio Connect you would add commands like the following to your nginx.conf file. This configuration assumes RStudio Connect is running on the same host as Nginx and listening for HTTP requests on the :3939 port. If you are proxying to RStudio Connect on a different machine or port, replace the localhost:3939 references with the correct address of the server where RStudio Connect is hosted.

```{conf}
http {
  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      close;
  }
  server {
    listen 80;

    client_max_body_size 0; # Disables checking of client request body size

    location / {
      proxy_set_header X-RSC-Request $scheme://$host:$server_port$request_uri;
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3939;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_buffering off; # Required for XHR-streaming
    }
  }
}

```

```{bash}
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
