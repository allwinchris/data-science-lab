Building R from source guarantees that R will run on your server, and it will allow you to run multiple versions of R side by side. Running multiple versions of R helps you maintain consistent R projects and Shiny apps over time.

You may need to include this line to install a variety of dependencies that R/RStudio Server may need.

```{bash}
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
```

Then, build R. It's recommended to build R from source on RedHat / CentOS

```{bash}
cd /opt
sudo wget https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.3.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf R-3.4.3.tar.gz 
cd R-3.4.3

sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt/R/3.4.3 --enable-R-shlib --with-blas --with-lapack
sudo make
sudo make install

/opt/R/3.4.3/bin/R
```
