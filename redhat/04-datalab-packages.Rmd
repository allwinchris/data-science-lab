It's useful to install some packages into the system library so that they are available to all R users. Install the following packages as `sudo` so they are available to all R users.

## install R packages

```{bash}
R
```

```{r}
install.packages(c("shiny", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "odbc",
"rstudioapi", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
```
